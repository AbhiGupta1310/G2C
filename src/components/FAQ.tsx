      question: "How do you evaluate my gold?",
      answer:
        "We use certified Karatmeter equipment to accurately test the purity of your gold. The process is non-destructive and takes just a few minutes. We test each item individually and show you the results on our digital display. The final price is calculated based on the purity, weight, and current market rates.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer better rates than pawn shops?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we typically offer 80-85% of the current market rate, which is significantly higher than most pawn shops that offer 40-60%. We can offer better rates because we specialize in precious metals and have lower overhead costs. We also don't charge any hidden fees or deductions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is it safe to sell here?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely! We are licensed buyers with all necessary government approvals. Our store has CCTV surveillance, and we maintain detailed records of every transaction. We also provide proper receipts and documentation. Many of our customers are repeat clients who trust us with their valuable items.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get bank transfer instead of cash?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we offer both cash and bank transfer options. For amounts above â‚¹50,000, we recommend bank transfer for security reasons. Bank transfers are processed immediately using NEFT/RTGS, and you'll receive the amount within a few minutes during banking hours.",
    },
    {
      question: "What documents are required?",
      answer:
        "For transactions up to â‚¹49,999, you only need a valid photo ID (Aadhaar, PAN, Driving License, or Passport). For amounts above â‚¹50,000, we also require a PAN card as per government regulations. All photocopies are taken for our records.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you buy broken or damaged jewelry?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we buy gold and silver in any condition - broken, damaged, outdated designs, or even scrap pieces. The value is determined by weight and purity, not by the design or condition. In fact, you might get better value selling as scrap rather than trying to repair first.",
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is your online calculator?",
      answer:
        "Our online calculator provides a good estimate based on current market rates, but the final price depends on actual purity testing. The calculator assumes average purity levels, so the actual amount might vary by Â±5-10% after physical verification. We always guarantee transparent pricing with no hidden deductions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I negotiate the price?",
      answer:
        "Our prices are based on live market rates and standard industry margins, leaving little room for negotiation. However, we do offer the best possible rates in the market. For bulk transactions (over â‚¹1 lakh), we may offer slightly better rates. We believe in transparent, fair pricing rather than inflated quotes for negotiation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I change my mind after selling?",
      answer:
        "Once the transaction is completed and payment is made, the sale is final. However, if you have concerns immediately after the transaction, we're happy to discuss and resolve any issues. We recommend taking time to think before finalizing the sale if you're unsure.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the entire process take?",
      answer:
        "The entire process typically takes 15-30 minutes depending on the number of items. Testing takes 2-3 minutes per item, documentation takes 5-10 minutes, and payment is immediate. For bank transfers, processing takes an additional 5-10 minutes during banking hours.",
